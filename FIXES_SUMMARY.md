# Paged Memory Simulator - Fixes Summary

## Overview
All identified issues from the comprehensive testing have been successfully fixed. The program now handles edge cases robustly with proper input validation and comprehensive error handling.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. ✅ Negative Job Size Validation
**Problem**: Program accepted negative job sizes without validation
**Fix**: Added validation in `acceptJob()` function
```cpp
if (jobSize <= 0) {
    cout << "Error: Job size must be positive. Got: " << jobSize << " bytes" << endl;
    return false;
}
```
**Test Result**: ✅ PASS - Negative sizes are now properly rejected

### 2. ✅ Zero-Sized Job Handling
**Problem**: Zero-sized jobs were accepted and allocated 0 pages
**Fix**: Same validation as above - zero sizes are now rejected
**Test Result**: ✅ PASS - Zero sizes are properly rejected with clear error message

### 3. ✅ Input Validation for System Parameters
**Problem**: No validation for page size and frame count inputs
**Fix**: Added comprehensive input validation in `main()` function
```cpp
// Validate page size
if (pageSize <= 0) {
    cout << "Error: Page size must be positive. Got: " << pageSize << endl;
}
if (pageSize > 1024 * 1024) { // 1MB limit
    cout << "Error: Page size too large. Maximum: 1MB" << endl;
}

// Validate frame count
if (totalFrames <= 0) {
    cout << "Error: Frame count must be positive. Got: " << totalFrames << endl;
}
if (totalFrames > 1000) { // Reasonable limit
    cout << "Error: Too many frames. Maximum: 1000" << endl;
}
```
**Test Result**: ✅ PASS - Invalid inputs are properly rejected with retry loops

### 4. ✅ Negative Address Validation
**Problem**: Address resolution didn't validate negative logical addresses
**Fix**: Added validation in `resolveAddress()` function
```cpp
if (logicalAddress < 0) {
    cout << "Error: Logical address cannot be negative. Got: " << logicalAddress << endl;
    return false;
}
```
**Test Result**: ✅ PASS - Negative addresses are properly rejected

### 5. ✅ Negative Job ID Validation
**Problem**: Job removal didn't validate negative job IDs
**Fix**: Added validation in `removeJob()` function
```cpp
if (jobId <= 0) {
    cout << "Error: Job ID must be positive. Got: " << jobId << endl;
    return false;
}
```
**Test Result**: ✅ PASS - Negative job IDs are properly rejected

### 6. ✅ Enhanced Input Handling
**Problem**: Basic cin input didn't handle errors gracefully
**Fix**: Added robust input validation with error recovery
```cpp
if (!(cin >> input)) {
    cout << "Error: Invalid input. Please enter a number." << endl;
    cin.clear();
    cin.ignore(numeric_limits<streamsize>::max(), '\n');
    continue;
}
```
**Test Result**: ✅ PASS - Invalid inputs are handled gracefully with retry

### 7. ✅ Job Names with Spaces
**Problem**: Job names couldn't contain spaces
**Fix**: Changed from `cin >> jobName` to `getline(cin, jobName)`
**Test Result**: ✅ PASS - Job names with spaces work correctly
